It’s the thought of being youngWhen your heart’s just like a drumBeating louder with no way to guard itWhen it all seems like it’s wrongJust sing along to Elton JohnAnd to that feeling, we’re just getting startedWhen the nights get colderAnd the rhythms got you falling behindJust dream about that momentWhen you look yourself right in the eye, eye, eyeThen you sayI wanna danceThe music’s got me goingAin’t nothing that can stop how we move yeahLet’s break our plans And live just like we’re goldenAnd roll in like we’re dancing fools We don’t need to worry ‘Cause when we fall we know how to land Don’t need to talk the talk, just walk the walk tonight ‘Cause we don’t need permission to dance There’s always something that’s standing in the wayBut if you don’t let it faze yaYou’ll know just how to breakJust keep the right vibe yeah‘Cause there’s no looking backThere ain’t no one to proveWe don’t got this on lock yeahThe wait is overThe time is now so let’s do it right Yeah we’ll keep goingAnd stay up until we see the sunriseAnd we’ll sayI wanna danceThe music’s got me goingAin’t nothing that can stop how we move yeahLet’s break our plansAnd live just like we’re goldenAnd roll in like we’re dancing foolsWe don’t need to worry‘Cause when we fall we know how to landDon’t need to talk the talk, just walk the walk tonight‘Cause we don’t need permission to danceDa na na na na na naDa na na na na na naDa na na na na na naNo, we don’t need permission to dance Da na na na na na naDa na na na na na naDa na na na na na naWell let me show yaThat we can keep the fire alive‘Cause it’s not overTill it’s over say it one more timeSayI wanna danceThe music’s got me goingAin’t nothing that can stop how we move yeahLet’s break our plansAnd live just like we’re goldenAnd roll in like we’re dancing foolsWe don’t need to worry‘Cause when we fall we know how to landDon’t need to talk the talk, just walk the walk tonight‘Cause we don’t need permission to dance
