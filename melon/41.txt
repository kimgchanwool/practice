One touch and you got me stonedHigher than I've ever knownYou call the shots and I followSunrise but the night still young  No words but we speak in tonguesIf you let me I might say too muchYour touch blurred my visionIt's your world and I'm just in itEven sober I'm not thinkin' straight'Cause I'm off my facein love with youI'm out my head so into youand I don't know how you do itBut I'm forever ruined by youooh ooh oohCan't sleep'cause I'm way too buzzedToo late now you're in my bloodI don't hate the way you keep me upYour touch blurred my visionIt's your world and I'm just in itEven sober I'm not thinkin' straight'Cause I'm off my facein love with youI'm out my head so into youand I don't know how you do itBut I'm forever ruined by youooh ooh oohOoh-ooh-ooh ooh ooh ooh oohOoh-ooh-ooh ooh oohOoh-ooh-ooh ooh ooh ooh oohOoh-ooh-ooh ooh ooh'Cause I'm off my facein love with youI'm out my head so into youand I don't know how you do itBut I'm forever ruined by youooh ooh oohBy you ooh ooh ooh
