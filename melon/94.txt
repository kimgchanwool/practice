What’s two minus one? Hope you listen to this song ‘cause I, I, I ‘Cause I’m doing right just fine I’m doing all right, doing all right  All the time in the world to myself I can go out and drink all day and night But why can’t I get you off my mind  I can’t get you out of my head, yeah Gotta get you out of my head, yeah How can you be so fine when I’m, I’m, 아야야  Two minus one I can see you’re doing really good without me, baby Two minus one I’m doing great myself  Hope you know I am  ‘Cause I’m not lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, yeah Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, yeah Two minus one I’m super fine I don’t need you anymore  And everytime I see you in my feed, I don’t feel anything anymore We used to be best friends I remember you said that you can be yourself when I’m around Guess that didn’t really matter All the feelings we had were not worth much to you at all Well I moved on, so keep your two cents Sympathy subtraction  I can’t get you out of my head, yeah Gotta get you out of my head, yeah How can you be so fine when I’m, I’m, I’m, I’m  Two minus one I can see you’re doing really good without me, baby Two minus one I’m doing great myself  Hope you know I am  ‘Cause I’m not lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, yeah Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, yeah Two minus one I’m super fine I don’t need you anymore  I thought you were the one Didn’t need any other I can still smell the perfume you used to wear in my clothes  Can’t erase it, no  I used to think you were that someone We used be so much alike  I can still see you in myself  Love is so blinding Love is so blinding   Two minus one I can see you’re doing really good without me, baby Two minus one I’m doing great myself  Hope you know I am  ‘Cause I’m not lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, yeah Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, yeah Two minus one I’m super fine I don’t need you anymore  Don’t need you anymore  I need you
