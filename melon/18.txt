Every time you come aroundyou know I can’t say noEvery time the sun goes downI let you take controlI can feel the paradisebefore my world implodesand tonight had something wonderfulMy bad habits lead to late nightsending aloneConversations with a strangerI barely knowSwearing this will be the lastbut it probably won’tI’ve got nothing left to loseor use or doMy bad habits to lead towide eyes stare into spaceAnd I know I lose controlof the things that I sayI was looking for a way outnow I can’t escapeNothing happens after twoIt’s true it’s trueMy bad habits lead to youMy bad habits lead to youEvery pure intention endswhen the good times startFalling over everything toreach the first times sparkStarted under neon lightsthen it all got darkI only know how to go too farMy bad habits lead to late nightsending aloneConversations with a strangerI barely knowSwearing this will be the lastbut it probably won’tI’ve got nothing left to loseor use or doMy bad habits to lead towide eyes stare into spaceAnd I know I lose controlof the things that I sayI was looking for a way outnow I can’t escapeNothing happens after twoIt’s true it’s trueMy bad habits lead to youMy bad habits lead to youWe took the long way roundAnd burned til the fun ran out nowMy bad habits lead to late nightsending aloneConversations with a strangerI barely knowSwearing this will be the lastbut it probably won’tI’ve got nothing left to loseor use or doMy bad habits to lead to wide eyesstare into spaceAnd I know I lose controlof the things that I sayI was looking for a way outnow I can’t escapeNothing happens after twoIt’s true it’s trueMy bad habits lead to youMy bad habits lead to youMy bad habits lead to you
